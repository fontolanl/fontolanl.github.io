								I am a computational neuroscientist interested in how neural interactions give rise to cognitive phenomena, 
								how brain circuits change during learning, and how mental disorders disrupt 
								communication pathways in the brain. Currently, I am a research scientist in the laboratory 
								of Dr. Sandro Romani at Janelia Research Campus - HHMI.

								<b>Education:</b>
								<br>
								<p>
								I earned a Bachelor's and a Master’s degree in Physics from La Sapienza University of Rome, 
								with a focus in dynamical systems, condensed matter physics, statistical mechanics, and biophysics. 
								I became interested in neuroscience thanks to 
								the lectures of Prof. Daniel Amit in artificial neural networks, where I discovered for 
								the first time that brain circuits can be analyzed and explained with the quantitative 
								methods of physics and mathematics. I then won a scholarship to study abroad and 
								worked for a year in the lab of Prof. Stefano Fusi at Columbia University, studying 
								the efficient storage of ultrametrically correlated memory patterns in Hopfield networks,
								which eventually led to my Master’s thesis work.
								<p/>
								<br />
								<p>
								I did my PhD under the supervision of Prof. Anne-Lise Giraud at University of Geneva 
								and Prof. Boris Gutkin at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris. I investigated the neural basis
								of speech processing, both with computational models and by analyzing neurophysiological data 
								from human patients. 
								<p/>
								<br />
								<p>
								During my postdoc years I have been studying the neurobiological mechanisms of decision-making during motor planning.
								To do so, I built computational models of brain circuits and collaborated with the laboratory of Dr. Karel Svoboda to 
								test the predictions from these models with optogenetic experiments in rodents.
